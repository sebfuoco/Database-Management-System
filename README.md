# Database-Management-System
This system comes with a website connected to a database and allows users to login/register onto the site. These users can add data into
textboxes, amend current details, and remove them if need be; which will affect the corresponding data in the database. This system uses WampServer, where the SQL file contains all the tables 
required for the system to work and the php files go within the "www" directory.
